# problem 1
def num():
    return 15
print(num())
#answer is 15

# problem 2
def number_of_movies():
    return 10
    return 20
print(number_of_movies())
#answer is 10 because once 10 was returned, 20 is not recognized so 10 is skipped

# problem 3
def number_of_fingers():
    return 5
    print(10)
print(number_of_fingers())
#answer is 5 because it bypasses printing 10 due to indentation, if print(10) were to be unindented then it would pring out both 10 and 5
